#+author: Nicola Ferru Aka NFVblog


** Description
ResistorCalc is a calculator based on the color band system that is used to identify the specifications of resistors, it is a very simple Java program that allows the calculation of resistors with 3, 4, 5, 6 color bands.

*** 4 bands by default?
The program is set by default to 4 color bands since this category of resistors are the most widespread today.

** Color Table
| Color  | 1 band | 2 band | 3 band | Multiplier | Tolerance |
| Black  |      0 |      0 |      0 | 1ohm       |           |
| Brown  |      1 |      1 |      1 | 10ohm      |        1% |
| Red    |      2 |      2 |      2 | 100ohm     |        2% |
| Orange |      3 |      3 |      3 | 1k ohm     |           |
| Yellow |      4 |      4 |      4 | 10k ohm    |           |
| Green  |      5 |      5 |      5 | 100k ohm   |      0.5% |
| Blue   |      6 |      6 |      6 | 1M ohm     |     0.25% |
| Violet |      7 |      7 |      7 | 10M ohm    |      0.1% |
| Grey   |      8 |      8 |      8 |            |     0.05% |
| White  |      9 |      9 |      9 |            |           |
| Gold   |        |        |        |            |        5% |
| Silver |        |        |        |            |       10% |
